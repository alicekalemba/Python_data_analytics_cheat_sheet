# Python Data Analytics Cheat Sheet

This a cheatsheet to include most commonly used functions in Data Analysis with 
Python and other major libraries like Pandas, Sci-kitlearn, Seaborn, etc

For beginnerts, the diagram below shows a basic ogranization of functions and 
their usage in Python.

The diagram has the most commonly used classes such as `String`, `List`. It has also 
common core funcyion such as `enumarate`. 

This readme will split into sections. Each section will have commonly used fucctions
belonging to the Class or Library, and a few examples. Futher documentation is linked
to w3schools for Python and Pandas libs for Pandas.

### Core

#### enumerate()
[Official Docs](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_enumerate.asp)

The enumerate function is among then inbuilt functions that adds a counter to 
an iterable and returns an iterator(turple) in the format `index, element`

_Example 1_

```fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)
```
_output:_

```
0 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
```

_Example 2_

Incase you want the counter to start with a different value
```fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for index, fruit in enumerator(fruits, start=1):
    print(index, fruit)
```
_output_

```
1 apple
2 banana
3 cherry
```

### String

##### join()

[Official Docs](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_join.asp)
The join function is a string method that returns a string in which the elements 
of a sequence have been joined by a specified delimiter. Its also called a 
delimiter string.

_Example 1_
```
words = ["Hello", "world"]
result = ' '.join(words)
print(result)
```
_output:_

`Hello world`

_Example 2_
```
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
result = ', '.join(words)
print(result)
```
_output:_

`apple, banana, cherry`

_Example 3_

```
lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]
result = '\n'.join(lines)
print(result)
```
_output:_

```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
```


### List

##### append()
[Official Docs](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_append.asp)

The append function adds a variable to a list. 

_Example 1_
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print (my_list)
```
_output:_

`[1, 2, 3, 4]`

_Example 2_

```
my_list = ["a", "b", "c"]
my_list.append("d")
print (my_list)
```
_output:_

`["a", "b", "c", "d"]`


### Pandas dataframe

#### read_csv()
[Official Docs] (https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_csv.asp)

This is one of the most used functions in pandas for reading data into a dataframe. The csv stands for comma-separated values.
The csv files are the most common import and export format for spreadsheets and databases.

Used as;

`import pandas as pd`

`df = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')`

pd.read_csv is the function.
customer_data.csv' is the file you are importing. 


#### describe()
[Official Docs](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/ref_df_describe.asp#:~:text=The%20describe()%20method%20returns,The%20average%20(mean)%20value.)


The `describe()` is a method/function that provides descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a datasetâ€™s distribution, excluding NaN values. It is used mostly in Machine learning, it basically returns the
description of the dataframe.


_Example 1_

```
data = {
'TransactionID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
'StoreLocation': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'New York', 'Chicago', 'Los Angeles'],
'Date': ['2021-01-01', '2021-01-02', '2021-01-02', '2021-01-02', '2021-01-03'],
'ItemCategory': ['Electronics', 'Apparel', 'Toys', 'Electronics', 'Apparel'],
'UnitPrice': [299.99, 49.99, 15.99, 199.99, 39.99],
'UnitsSold': [3, 5, 10, 1, 2]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df[['UnitPrice', 'UnitsSold']].describe())
```

_output_

`UnitPrice   UnitsSold

count 5.000000 5.000000
mean 121.190000 4.200000
std 123.398541 3.563706
min 15.990000 1.000000
25% 39.990000 2.000000
50% 49.990000 3.000000
75% 199.990000 5.000000
max 299.990000 10.000000`

The `mean` is the average value of the dataset. It is calculated by summing up all the values in a data set and then dividing by the number of values. In the context of the example provided earlier where we calculated the summary statistics for 'UnitPrice' and 'UnitsSold' using `describe()`, the mean tells us the average unit price and average number of units sold across all transactions in our sample dataset.
It is used for example in comparative analysis, benchmarking among others, for example, if a particular transaction has a much higher unit price than the mean, it could be considered an outlier.
